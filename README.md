The code is complete, with the physics portion being the crucial piece. Use the necessary, required, or desired portions to build your own. The code segments are detached and may contain errors and typos. The physics equations are what was important; analysis of the quantized point. Translation of carbon imprint data into physical object representations is a method or approach that's possible or isolating the finite exponential ends, including the absolute middle, of a quantized point. Mapping it to a space to reference is also possible.

No release package planned or intended; more "applications" are "laid-out" in the "issues" section.


Words to read:

It works in different formats for use.
Assembly code required for builds.
Containing the wave function was the last missing piece.

Crimefinderapp - Works based on the quantum physics property of quantized points. Quantized points make up a quantized point.

Applications:

Find unknown criminals and evidence by their namesake and description.
Evidence and individuals’ locations.

Curefinderapp:

Worked to function as a potential blood infection cure.

Finderapp:

Found the exponents correlating to several random objects.

"Ten Steps"Application:

 Ten Steps To Truth 

If you tell a lie you will not remain or regain the space that the truth is designated in.
The truth "markers" allocate to one space. The lie "markers" spiral outside of the space.

 * Say a truth out loud; ex. 2+2=4
 * Take 10 steps and put a marker on the floor.
 * Repeat until you are satisfied
 * Tell a lie; ex. 2+2=67
 * Take 10 steps and put markers on the floor until satisfied

This provides a noticeable effect where you can see the markers for the truth gathering in the same space and the markers for the lies trialing away from the space.

The psychological factors are on the outside and therefore rely on the average length of a step. if you attempt to disrupt the process it can take a micron length and require a microscope to measure the unique identifiers of eyeballs, fingerprints and toe prints.
