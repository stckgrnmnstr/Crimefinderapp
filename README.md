The code is complete, with the physics portion being the crucial piece. Use the necessary, required, or desired portions to build your own. The code segments are detached and may contain errors and typos. The physics equations are what was important; analysis of the quantized point. Translation of carbon imprint data into physical object representations is a method or approach that's possible; including a quantized point. Mapping it to a space to reference is also possible.

No release package planned or intended; more "applications" are "laid-out" in the "issues" section.

"Ten Steps"Application:

 Ten Steps To Truth 

If you tell a lie you will not remain or regain the space that the truth is designated in.
The truth "markers" allocate to one space. The lie "markers" spiral outside of the space.

 * Say a truth out loud; ex. 2+2=4
 * Take 10 steps and put a marker on the floor.
 * Repeat until you are satisfied
 * Tell a lie; ex. 2+2=67
 * Take 10 steps and put markers on the floor until satisfied

This provides a noticeable effect where you can see the markers for the truth gathering in the same space and the markers for the lies trialing away from the space.

The psychological factors are on the outside and therefore rely on the average length of a step. if you attempt to disrupt the process it can take a micron length and require a microscope to measure the unique identifiers of eyeballs, fingerprints and toe prints.



Polygon Creation From Carbon Emissions:

Brief Explanation of Polygon Analysis Program

The polygon analysis program is designed to analyze the interaction between polygons, which are created from carbon emission points mapped in a 2D space. It simulates physical activities by examining how polygons overlap, touch, or relate spatially to one another. The program outputs descriptions of these polygon interactions and correlates them with predefined human activities such as "walking," "jogging," or "standing still."

Main Components:
1. Emission Data Generation**: 
   - The program generates random points representing carbon emissions in a 2D space.
   - These points are used to form polygons via the convex hull of the emission points.

2. Polygon Creation**: 
   - Polygons are created from emission points, and multiple polygons are generated to simulate various objects or entities in the space.

3. Polygon Interaction Analysis**:
   - The program analyzes how the polygons interact with each other, looking for overlaps, touching points, containment, or disjointed relationships.

4. Activity Mapping**:
   - Based on the relationships between the polygons, the program maps interactions to human activities. For example:
     - **Overlapping polygons** might indicate "jogging."
     - **Touching polygons** might indicate "walking."
     - **Contained polygons** might indicate "standing still."
   - These relationships are then outputted as human-readable descriptions of activities.

5. Visualization**:
   - The program includes a feature to visualize the polygons and their interactions, allowing you to see the geometric relationships that represent different activities.

Output:

The program generates descriptions such as:
```
Polygon 0 overlaps with Polygon 1: Polygon confirmed as male humanoid engaged in physical activity: jogging.
Polygon 1 and Polygon 2 are disjoint: Polygon confirmed as male humanoid engaged in physical activity: no activity detected.
```

This program is useful for analyzing how certain geometric properties of polygons (like shape, interaction, and position) can simulate and describe physical activities based on carbon emission data.
